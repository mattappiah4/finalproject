            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="large">I am a Junior at Towson University currently studying Information Technology.
            During my time at school I have become familiar with programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and Java.
            I am working on enhancing my programming skills while I take my classes, but I am fully confident in my abilities to
            be the helpful, reliable, and hardworking intern any company is looking for. Ever since I was a kid I've had a passion for technology and computers.</p>
            <p class="large">I believe that the internet is an amazing resource, and that should be used by everyone. But unfortuntely there are attackers and hackers who use the internet to steal information from people without them knowning.
            There is a vast amount of ways hackers can steal your money, identity, and other personal information. My dream is to be a Network Engineer so I can protect various computer networks.
            By watching over computer databases, I will be able to catch any malicious attacks or malware.</p>
            <p class="large">Even though I want to be a Network Engineer, I am happy to gain skills in web development too. One day I want to be able to
            start my own business where I can make websites for small and local businesses. Being that this is my first ever originally made website this will be an amazing starting point for me!
