            <p class="large">This a website that was developed by me, Matthew Appiah, to show off the skills I have gained from my Web Technologies class! Being a student at Towson University, I have developed a passion for programming and coding.
            So I wanted to show tht passion in the making of this website for myself and for my final project!</p>
            <p class="large">This website is to prove that I have taken the knowledge from class and I am able to implement them into this project! During the making of this project I had lots of fun but also hardships that came with it. Being that this will be one
            of my biggest projects I take a lot of pride in saying that it was made by me! Please feel free to explore my website to see all of the pages I have created!</p>
